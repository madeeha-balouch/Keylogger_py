# Keylogger_py
This project is an attempt to create a keylogger for windows using python. It captures all the keystrokes pressed on a keyboard and stores them in a .txt file. There are some additional if statements to display the keystrokes in a way that makes sense out of the data typed by the victim.

Required library: pynput 
Installation via command prompt: pip install pynput
This library is essentially to control and monitor the input devices using python (currently available for keyboard and mouse only)

more information about the library can be found here: https://pynput.readthedocs.io/en/latest/keyboard.html
